I have enrolled into this amazing course named "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy. As a part of the course, we are asked to build a mini project after every lesson gets over. 
This repo contains all the mini projects that I have built myself (and mostly debugged using th ehelp of chat-gpt) using my knowledge in Python.
